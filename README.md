# Mobile Application for Personalized Home Maintenance Services "Ejadah"

### Overview
**Ejadah** is a joint university project at **Qassim University**, supervised by **Prof. Ali Alkhalifah**, to create an Android application that revolutionizes home maintenance services. The application bridges the gap between homeowners and service providers by integrating modern technologies to deliver user-centric, data-driven, and reliable solutions to common maintenance challenges.
#
### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Dart with Flutter for cross-platform application development.
- **Backend:** Firebase for real-time database and authentication.
- **Object Detection:** Python-based AI algorithms using YOLOv5 for identifying issues.
- **GPS Tracking:** Integration with Google Maps API for real-time location sharing.
